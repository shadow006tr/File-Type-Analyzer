This is my code from HyperSkill's File Type Analyzer Project.</br>
</br>
The [project](https://github.com/shadow006tr/File-Type-Analyzer---My-Solutions---HyperSkill.org/tree/master/Project/src/analyzer) itself is the main part of my code but there's also some of my solutions to the topic problems.</br>
I will submit new files once I complete every chapter.</br>
