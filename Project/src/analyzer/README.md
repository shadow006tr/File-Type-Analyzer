# File Type Analyzer #
## a HyperSkill.org project ##
### in progress ###

> This is my code from HyperSkill's File Type Analyzer Project.
>
> The program will determine a file type by searching a specific pattern in it
>
> Takes 4 arguments
>
>> 1.Algorithm - the preferred algorithm ro find the pattern in the binary file, (for now you can use --naive or --KMP)
>> 2.FilePath - the path to the binary file.
>> 3.Pattern - the pattern to search for.
>> 4.Result - the string you want to be printed if the pattern is found in the file
>
> In the case the pattern will not be found in the file,
> the program will print "Unknown file type"
