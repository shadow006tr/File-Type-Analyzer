# File Type Analyzer #
## a HyperSkill.org project ##
### in progress ###

> This is my code from HyperSkill's File Type Analyzer Project.
>
> The program will determine a file type by searching a specific pattern in it.
>
> It will go by all of the files in a folder and check them for the pattern.
> Each file will be checked in a different thread, based on the amount available in your processor
>
> Takes 3 arguments
>
>> 1.Folder - the path to a folder with files / other folders.
>>
>> 2.Pattern - the pattern to search for.
>>
>> 3.Result - the string you want to be printed if the pattern is found in the file
>
>
> In the case the pattern will not be found in the file,
> the program will print "Unknown file type"
