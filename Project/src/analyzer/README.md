<h1> File Type Analyzer </h1>
<h2> a HyperSkill.org project </h2>
<h3> in progress </h3>
<p>
This is my code from HyperSkill's File Type Analyzer Project.</br>
</br>
The program will determine a file type by searching a specific pattern in it</br>
</br>
Takes 4 arguments</br>
</br>
    1.Algorithm - the preferred algorithm ro find the pattern in the binary file, (for now you can use --naive or --KMP)</br>
    2.FilePath - the path to the binary file.</br>
    3.Pattern - the pattern to search for.</br>
    4.Result - the string you want to be printed if the pattern is found in the file)</br>
</br>
In the case the pattern will not be found in the file,</br>
the program will print "Unknown file type"</br>
